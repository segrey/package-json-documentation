    <full-description><![CDATA[
<p>The <em>most</em> important things in your package.json are the name and version fields.
Those are actually required, and your package won't install without
them.  The name and version together form an identifier that is assumed
to be completely unique.  Changes to the package should come along with
changes to the version.</p>

<p>The name is what your thing is called.  Some tips:</p>

<ul><li>Don't put "js" or "node" in the name.  It's assumed that it's js, since you're
writing a package.json file, and you can specify the engine using the "engines"
field.  (See below.)</li><li>The name ends up being part of a URL, an argument on the command line, and a
folder name. Any name with non-url-safe characters will be rejected.
Also, it can't start with a dot or an underscore.</li><li>The name will probably be passed as an argument to require(), so it should
be something short, but also reasonably descriptive.</li><li>You may want to check the npm registry to see if there's something by that name
already, before you get too attached to it.  http://registry.npmjs.org/</li></ul>]]></full-description>

to just specify the name of the license you're using, like this:</p>

<pre><code>{ "license" : "BSD" }</code></pre>

<p>If you have more complex licensing terms, or you want to provide more detail
in your package.json file, you can use the more verbose plural form, like this:</p>

<pre><code>"licenses" : [
  { "type" : "MyLicense"

much else.</p>]]></full-description>

  <entry name="bin">
    <short-description>Executable files to install into PATH</short-description>
    <full-description><![CDATA[
<p>A lot of packages have one or more executable files that they'd like to
install into the PATH. npm makes this pretty easy (in fact, it uses this
feature to install the "npm" executable.)</p>

<p>To use this, supply a <code>bin</code> field in your package.json which is a map of
command name to local file name. On install, npm will symlink that file into
<code>prefix/bin</code> for global installs, or <code>./node_modules/.bin/</code> for local
installs.</p>

<p>For example, npm has this:</p>

<pre><code>{ "bin" : { "npm" : "./cli.js" } }</code></pre>

<p>So, when you install npm, it'll create a symlink from the <code>cli.js</code> script to
<code>/usr/local/bin/npm</code>.</p>

<p>If you have a single executable, and its name should be the name
of the package, then you can just supply it as a string.  For example:</p>

<pre><code>{ "name": "my-program"
, "version": "1.2.5"
, "bin": "./path/to/program" }</code></pre>

<p>would be the same as this:</p>

<pre><code>{ "name": "my-program"
, "version": "1.2.5"
, "bin" : { "my-program" : "./path/to/program" } }</code></pre>]]></full-description>

  <entry name="man">
    <short-description>Documentation files for man</short-description>
    <full-description><![CDATA[
<p>Specify either a single file or an array of filenames to put in place for the
<code>man</code> program to find.</p>

<p>If only a single file is provided, then it's installed such that it is the
result from <code>man &lt;pkgname&gt;</code>, regardless of its actual filename.  For example:</p>

<pre><code>{ "name" : "foo"
, "version" : "1.2.3"
, "description" : "A packaged foo fooer for fooing foos"
, "main" : "foo.js"
, "man" : "./man/doc.1"
}</code></pre>

<p>would link the <code>./man/doc.1</code> file in such that it is the target for <code>man foo</code></p>

<p>If the filename doesn't start with the package name, then it's prefixed.
So, this:</p>

<pre><code>{ "name" : "foo"
, "version" : "1.2.3"
, "description" : "A packaged foo fooer for fooing foos"
, "main" : "foo.js"
, "man" : [ "./man/foo.1", "./man/bar.1" ]
}</code></pre>

<p>will create files to do <code>man foo</code> and <code>man foo-bar</code>.</p>

<p>Man files must end with a number, and optionally a <code>.gz</code> suffix if they are
compressed.  The number dictates which man section the file is installed into.</p>

<pre><code>{ "name" : "foo"
, "version" : "1.2.3"
, "description" : "A packaged foo fooer for fooing foos"
, "main" : "foo.js"
, "man" : [ "./man/foo.1", "./man/foo.2" ]
}</code></pre>

<p>will create entries for <code>man foo</code> and <code>man 2 foo</code></p>]]></full-description>

    <short-description>Structure of package</short-description>
    <full-description><![CDATA[
<p>The CommonJS <a href="http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Packages/1.0">Packages</a> spec details a
few ways that you can indicate the structure of your package using a <code>directories</code>
hash. If you look at <a href="http://registry.npmjs.org/npm/latest">npm's package.json</a>,
you'll see that it has directories for doc, lib, and man.</p>

<p>In the future, this information may be used in other creative ways.</p>

<h3 id="directories-lib">directories.lib</h3>

<p>Tell people where the bulk of your library is.  Nothing special is done
with the lib folder in any way, but it's useful meta info.</p>

<h3 id="directories-bin">directories.bin</h3>

<p>If you specify a "bin" directory, then all the files in that folder will
be used as the "bin" hash.</p>

<p>If you have a "bin" hash already, then this has no effect.</p>

<h3 id="directories-man">directories.man</h3>

<p>A folder that is full of man pages.  Sugar to generate a "man" array by
walking the folder.</p>

<h3 id="directories-doc">directories.doc</h3>

<p>Put markdown files in here.  Eventually, these will be displayed nicely,
maybe, someday.</p>

<h3 id="directories-example">directories.example</h3>

<p>Put example scripts in here.  Someday, it might be exposed in some clever way.</p>]]></full-description>

  <entry name="repository">
    <short-description>Repository of code</short-description>
    <full-description><![CDATA[
<p>Specify the place where your code lives. This is helpful for people who
want to contribute.  If the git repo is on github, then the <code>npm docs</code>
command will be able to find you.</p>

<p>Do it like this:</p>

<pre><code>"repository" :
  { "type" : "git"
  , "url" : "http://github.com/isaacs/npm.git"
  }

"repository" :
  { "type" : "svn"
  , "url" : "http://v8.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/"
  }</code></pre>

<p>The URL should be a publicly available (perhaps read-only) url that can be handed
directly to a VCS program without any modification.  It should not be a url to an
html project page that you put in your browser.  It's for computers.</p>]]></full-description>

    <full-description><![CDATA[
<p>The "scripts" member is an object hash of script commands that are run
at various times in the lifecycle of your package.  The key is the lifecycle

    <short-description>Configuration parameters</short-description>
    <full-description><![CDATA[
<p>A "config" hash can be used to set configuration
parameters used in package scripts that persist across upgrades.  For
instance, if a package had the following:</p>

<pre><code>{ "name" : "foo"
, "config" : { "port" : "8080" } }</code></pre>

<p>and then had a "start" command that then referenced the
<code>npm_package_config_port</code> environment variable, then the user could
override that by doing <code>npm config set foo:port 8001</code>.</p>

<p>See <code><a href="https://npmjs.org/doc/misc/npm-config.html">npm-config(7)</a></code> and <code><a href="https://npmjs.org/doc/misc/npm-scripts.html">npm-scripts(7)</a></code> for more on package

  <entry name="dependencies">
    <short-description>Dependencies of package</short-description>
    <full-description><![CDATA[
<p>Dependencies are specified with a simple hash of package name to
version range. The version range is a string which has one or more
space-separated descriptors.  Dependencies can also be identified with
a tarball or git URL.</p>

<p><strong>Please do not put test harnesses or transpilers in your
<code>dependencies</code> hash.</strong>  See <code>devDependencies</code>, below.</p>

<p>See <a href="https://npmjs.org/doc/misc/semver.html">semver(7)</a> for more details about specifying version ranges.</p>

<ul><li><code>version</code> Must match <code>version</code> exactly</li><li><code>&gt;version</code> Must be greater than <code>version</code></li><li><code>&gt;=version</code> etc</li><li><code>&lt;version</code></li><li><code>&lt;=version</code></li><li><code>~version</code> "Approximately equivalent to version"  See <a href="https://npmjs.org/doc/misc/semver.html">semver(7)</a></li><li><code>1.2.x</code> 1.2.0, 1.2.1, etc., but not 1.3.0</li><li><code>http://...</code> See 'URLs as Dependencies' below</li><li><code>*</code> Matches any version</li><li><code>""</code> (just an empty string) Same as <code>*</code></li><li><code>version1 - version2</code> Same as <code>&gt;=version1 &lt;=version2</code>.</li><li><code>range1 || range2</code> Passes if either range1 or range2 are satisfied.</li><li><code>git...</code> See 'Git URLs as Dependencies' below</li></ul>

<p>For example, these are all valid:</p>

<pre><code>{ "dependencies" :
  { "foo" : "1.0.0 - 2.9999.9999"
  , "bar" : "&gt;=1.0.2 &lt;2.1.2"
  , "baz" : "&gt;1.0.2 &lt;=2.3.4"
  , "boo" : "2.0.1"
  , "qux" : "&lt;1.0.0 || &gt;=2.3.1 &lt;2.4.5 || &gt;=2.5.2 &lt;3.0.0"
  , "asd" : "http://asdf.com/asdf.tar.gz"
  , "til" : "~1.2"
  , "elf" : "~1.2.3"
  , "two" : "2.x"
  , "thr" : "3.3.x"
  }
}</code></pre>

<h3 id="URLs-as-Dependencies">URLs as Dependencies</h3>

<p>You may specify a tarball URL in place of a version range.</p>

<p>This tarball will be downloaded and installed locally to your package at
install time.</p>

<h3 id="Git-URLs-as-Dependencies">Git URLs as Dependencies</h3>

<p>Git urls can be of the form:</p>

<pre><code>git://github.com/user/project.git#commit-ish
git+ssh://user@hostname:project.git#commit-ish
git+ssh://user@hostname/project.git#commit-ish
git+http://user@hostname/project/blah.git#commit-ish
git+https://user@hostname/project/blah.git#commit-ish</code></pre>

<p>The <code>commit-ish</code> can be any tag, sha, or branch which can be supplied as
an argument to <code>git checkout</code>.  The default is <code>master</code>.</p>]]></full-description>

  <entry name="devDependencies">
    <short-description>Development dependencies of package</short-description>
    <full-description><![CDATA[
<p>If someone is planning on downloading and using your module in their
program, then they probably don't want or need to download and build
the external test or documentation framework that you use.</p>

<p>In this case, it's best to list these additional items in a
<code>devDependencies</code> hash.</p>

<p>These things will be installed when doing <code>npm link</code> or <code>npm install</code>
from the root of a package, and can be managed like any other npm
configuration param.  See <code><a href="https://npmjs.org/doc/misc/npm-config.html">npm-config(7)</a></code> for more on the topic.</p>

<p>For build steps that are not platform-specific, such as compiling
CoffeeScript or other languages to JavaScript, use the <code>prepublish</code>
script to do this, and make the required package a devDependency.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p><code>json
{ "name": "ethopia-waza",
  "description": "a delightfully fruity coffee varietal",
  "version": "1.2.3",
  "devDependencies": {
    "coffee-script": "~1.6.3"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "prepublish": "coffee -o lib/ -c src/waza.coffee"
  },
  "main": "lib/waza.js"
}
</code></p>

<p>The <code>prepublish</code> script will be run before publishing, so that users
can consume the functionality without requiring them to compile it
themselves.  In dev mode (ie, locally running <code>npm install</code>), it'll
run this script as well, so that you can test it easily.</p>]]></full-description>

    <short-description>Options dependencies</short-description>
    <full-description><![CDATA[
<p>If a dependency can be used, but you would like npm to proceed if it
cannot be found or fails to install, then you may put it in the
<code>optionalDependencies</code> hash.  This is a map of package name to version
or url, just like the <code>dependencies</code> hash.  The difference is that
failure is tolerated.</p>

<p>It is still your program's responsibility to handle the lack of the
dependency.  For example, something like this:</p>

<pre><code>try {
  var foo = require('foo')
  var fooVersion = require('foo/package.json').version
} catch (er) {
  foo = null
}
if ( notGoodFooVersion(fooVersion) ) {
  foo = null
}

// .. then later in your program ..

if (foo) {
  foo.doFooThings()
}</code></pre>

<p>Entries in <code>optionalDependencies</code> will override entries of the same name in
<code>dependencies</code>, so it's usually best to only put in one place.</p>]]></full-description>

<p>And, like with dependencies, if you don't specify the version (or if you
specify "*" as the version), then any version of node will do.</p>

<p>If you specify an "engines" field, then npm will require that "node" be
somewhere on that list. If "engines" is omitted, then npm will just assume
that it works on node.</p>

<p>You can also use the "engines" field to specify which versions of npm
are capable of properly installing your program.  For example:</p>

<pre><code>{ "engines" : { "npm" : "~1.0.20" } }</code></pre>

<p>Note that, unless the user has set the <code>engine-strict</code> config flag, this
field is advisory only.</p>]]></full-description>

    <full-description><![CDATA[
<p>If you are sure that your module will <em>definitely not</em> run properly on
versions of Node/npm other than those specified in the <code>engines</code> hash,
then you can set <code>"engineStrict": true</code> in your package.json file.
This will override the user's <code>engine-strict</code> config setting.</p>

<p>Please do not do this unless you are really very very sure.  If your
engines hash is something overly restrictive, you can quite easily and
inadvertently lock yourself into obscurity and prevent your users from
updating to new versions of Node.  Consider this choice carefully.  If
people abuse it, it will be removed in a future version of npm.</p>]]></full-description>
